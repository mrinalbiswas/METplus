        "Scientific Objective\n--------------------\n\nRun PCPCombine, EnsembleStat, and RegridDataPlane tools to create surrogate severe probability \nforecasts (SSPFs) for a given date. SSPFs are a severe weather forecasting tool and is a techniqu\nused by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) as well as others. SSPFs are based on updraft helicity \n(UH; UH = \u222bz0 to zt (\u03c9 * \u03b6) dz) since certain thresholds of UH have been shown as good proxies for# severe weather. SSPFs can be thought of as the perfect model forecast. They are derived as follows:\n\n   1. Regrid the maximum UH value over the 2-5km layer at each grid point to the NCEP 211 grid (dx = ~80km).\n   2. Create a binary mask of points that meet a given threshold of UH)\n   3. Convert the binary mask into a probability field by applying a Gaussian filter.\n\nFor more information, please reference Sobash et al. 2011 (https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/WAF-D-10-05046.1).\n\n"
